# Packages {#packages}

This chapter describes the recommended roles of R packages in `targets` pipelines and how to manage them in different situations.

## Loading and configuring R packages

For most pipelines, it is straightforward to load the R packages that your targets need in order to run. You can either:

1. Call `library()` at the top of the target script file (default: `_targets.R`) to load each package the conventional way, or
2. Name the required packages using the `packages` argument of `tar_option_set()`. 

2\. is often faster, especially for utilities like `tar_visnetwork()`, because it avoids loading packages unless absolutely necessary.

Some package management workflows are more complicated. If your use special configuration with [conflicted](https://github.com/r-lib/conflicted), [`box`](https://klmr.me/box/), [`import`](https://import.rticulate.org/), or similar utility, please do your configuration inside a project-level `.Rprofile` file instead of the target script file (default: `_targets.R`). In addition, if you use distributed workers inside external containers (Docker, Singularity, AWS AMI, etc.) make sure each container has a copy of this same `.Rprofile` file where the R worker process spawns. This approach is ensures that all [remote workers](#hpc) are configured the same way as the local main process.

## Package management with `renv`

`targets` and `renv` work extremely well together as an overall reproducibility solution for data analysis pipelines. `targets` makes sure your results are up to date, and `renv` keeps track of the packages you use.

If you use [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/), then overhead from project initialization could slow down pipelines and [workers](#hpc). Fortunately, you can disable the slowest initialization checks to boost speed. After confirming at <https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/config.html> that you can safely disable these checks, you can write the following lines in your user-level `.Renviron` file:

```
RENV_CONFIG_RSPM_ENABLED=false
RENV_CONFIG_SANDBOX_ENABLED=false
RENV_CONFIG_SYNCHRONIZED_CHECK=false
```

## R packages as projects

It is good practice to organize the files of a `targets` project similar to a research compendium or R package. However, unless have a specific reason to do so, it is usually not necessary to literally implement your `targets` pipeline as an installable R package with its own `DESCRIPTION` file. A research compendium backed by a `renv` library and Git-backed version control is enough reproducibility for most projects.

## Target Factories

To make specific `targets` pipelines reusable, it is usually better to create a package with specialized target factories tailored to your use case. Packages [`stantargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/) and [`jagstargets`](https://wlandau.github.io/jagstargets/) are examples, and you can find more information on the broader R Targetopia at <https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/>.

## Package-based invalidation

Still, it is sometimes desirable to treat functions and objects from a package as dependencies when it comes to deciding which targets to rerun and which targets to skip. `targets` does not track package functions by default because this is not a common need. Usually, local package libraries do not need to change very often, and it is best to maintain a reproducible project library using [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

However, if you are developing a package alongside a `targets` pipeline that uses it, you may wish to invalidate certain targets as you make changes to your package. For example, if you are working on a novel statistical method, it is good practice to implement the method itself as an R package and perform the computation for the research paper in one or more `targets` pipelines.

To track the contents of packages `package1` and `package2`, you must

1. Fully install these packages with `install.packages()` or equivalent. `devtools::load_all()` is insufficient because it does not make the packages available to [parallel workers](#hpc).
2. Write the following in your target script file (default: `_targets.R`):


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# _targets.R
library(targets)
tar_option_set(
  packages = c("package1", "package2", ...), # `...` is for other packages.
  imports = c("package1", "package2")
)
list(
  tar_target(name = output, command = function_from_package1())
)
```

`packages = c("package1", "package2", ...)` tells `targets` to call `library(package1)`, `library(package2)`, etc. before running each target. `imports = c("package1", "package2")` tells `targets` to dive into the environments of `package1` and `package2` and reproducibly track all the objects and datasets as if they were part of the global environment. For example, if you define a function `function_from_package1()` in `package1`, then you should see a function node for `function_from_package1()` in the graph produced by `tar_visnetwork(targets_only = FALSE)`, and targets downstream of `function_from_package1()` will invalidate if you install an update to `package1` with a new version of `function_from_package1()`. The next time you call `tar_make()`, those invalidated targets will automatically rerun.

One limitation is that entire namespaced calls like `package1::function_from_package1()` are not registered in the dependency graph because of the limitations of the static code analysis capabilities of `targets` (powered by `codetools::findGlobals()`). `tar_target(name = output, command = function_from_package1())` has a dependency `function_from_package1()`, but `tar_target(name = output, command = package1::function_from_package1())` does not have a dependency `package1::function_from_package1()`. This is because `::` is treated as a function with arguments `package` and `function_from_package1`.
