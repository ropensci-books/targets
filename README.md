This repository is the [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) R package user manual. It contains in-depth discussion and walkthroughs of the main features of [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) and advice about best practices. The goal is to introduce new users to [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) and instill a thorough understanding of what it does, how it works, and when to use it. The manual is implemented as a typical [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) project with a single `_bookdown.yml` file at the top level and one R Markdown source file for each chapter. End users are encouraged to read the rendered output at <https://books.ropensci.org/targets>.
